Questions

1. I added the rule ids to the child creation wrangler event.
2. I waited for the child_initialized event to be raised by wrangler.
3. I used python to create a single threaded script of API calls.
4. Upon creating a new pico I could send it all of the previously created eci's and have the new pico (or parent pico) raise an event to each eci to have it added to its peers.
